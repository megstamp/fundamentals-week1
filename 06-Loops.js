// VI. Loops

// Often we need to repeat the same steps (block of code) over and over. For this, we use a loop.

// There are many kinds of loops (for, while, while..do, for..of, for..in), but the for loop is 
// the most common and important by far.

// Every loop requires 1. a starting point, 2. an ending point, and 3. a count / increment.

// For a for loop, we put these all in one set of parentheses:

for(let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  console.log(i)
}

// conventionally, we use i for our increment (counter)


// ~~~~ PRACTICE ~~~~

// 1. Create a loop that outputs the numbers 0 through 7.

// 2. Create a loop that counts down from 10 to 1.

// 3. Use a loop to say "I am amazing!" 10 times.
